# Weather-Search
## Description
A website which finds the weather of the city/country entered in the search bar using Open Weather API.

## How to use
Simply enter a city or country within the input bar and click 'Search'.

The card below the search bar will display the weather, temperature, humidity and wind speed within the city/country.

The background will also change into an image relating to the city/country.

## What I've learnt
This was my first time using an API.

From this project I understood how make calls to API and retrieve information relating to particular queries.

I've learnt how to catch errors when the API doesn't return any data and how to dynamically display information within the DOM.
